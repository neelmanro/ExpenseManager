# PlagiarismChecker  
Author â€“ Neel Manro, manroneel@gmail.com

A simple **Python-based Plagiarism Checker** that compares two essay files by removing stopwords, filtering unique words, and calculating a similarity score using set operations. This tool helps detect copied content with clear percentage-based feedback.

This project is built with beginner-friendly Python concepts like functions, file handling, sets, dictionaries, and conditionals. It runs entirely in the terminal.
